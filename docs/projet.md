# SaltyNos

## Description
SaltyNos is the best project on the Nostale Private Server Scene

## Project's Needs

### SaltyNos for Love
You are supposed to like what you do on SaltyNos, otherwise it means that you simply don't like what you do and you won't be as efficient as if you would like it.

### You are not alone !
You are not alone on the project, don't let other people in ignorance, if you have something to tell to improve the project, tell it !

If you have anything that may concerns you, tell it, we are open minded and we pay attention to each other.

### A project needs to be followed
A constantly developed project needs to be followed, otherwise it will happen that you will be completely lost, it means you are outdated, it will makes everyone's loosing time. (AFKing 1 month is not possible in a project lifetime)

### A good project needs good folks
As we focus to have a good projects, we need to build a serious and professional team

### Focus your IRL
It's not because you are in the project team that you need to spend your life for it, never forget your IRL !

IRL's enjoyment is one of the important things that will permit you to stay in a good mood :).


## Project's Goals

- Kill shitty nostale experiences (shitty nostale servers)

### Money
We will have three ways to earn money :



| SaltyNos | SaltySaaS | SaltyPlugins |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Best Nostale Private Server | Host your own server in a simple click (Server Hosting Platform) | Plugins we develop will be sold to partners |

All this money will be splitted over contributors (depending on which part your are contributing)

If your part is only concerning SaltyNos, your earnings will only be calculated on SaltyNos' earnings.

Criterias for payment amount calculation :


| Time invested | Difficulty |
| -------- | -------- |
| (the faster you are, the more you can do, the more you get paid)| If the work you are doing is really difficult, you will earn more |


### Big project management experience
We are about to manage hundred of people every single day :
  * Team
  * Players
  * Toxic people from internet


### A good team of fellow enthusiasts working on the same loved project
We are all enthusiasts and love Nostale, we couldn't enjoy GameForge's experience of Nostale

We then decided to open a Nostale Server that will bring best Nostale Experience people could imagine.
